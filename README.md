>*A repository for CloudComputing 2020SP.* 



It was quite challenging back then as an advanced course when I hadnt had any of the prerequisites (smh they just let me be enrolled), yet seemingly so amusing when I happened to scroll to this repo before my second year as a phd student. I was once so ~~stupid~~ inexperienced with network (maybe now as well) - some commits suggest it took days for me to start a socket. And it just continued to manifest as I struggled to make any requests of lab2 work on that ill server written in C, which finally eventuated my stickiness to python til now. Not to mention so many funny stories between me and the poor TA. Hope she got a good job with that extremely solid architecture background built by my persistent, frequent and interrogative harassment üôè.


Tbh, this is **the** class that dived me in networking research. Even if I got a B+, my curiousness beat inconfidence far and away. Most couses I had in college are quite bland, not provoking any interesting ideas. I once thought it was a waste of time being there, especially during the pandemic, when the fragility of life is so blatantly presented that peoples wondered how on earth to find and live out the true purpose of life. Well, I guess this is the purpose - to search for the unknown, and here I am ü§∑. 

Despite my three-times-a-day quitting thought, this readme will remain as it is, reminding me why I am here ~~until I really quit~~.
